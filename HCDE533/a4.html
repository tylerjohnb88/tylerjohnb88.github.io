                <h3>Cubic Cent</h3>
                <p>This week I learned a new machine and software combo and
                  how to hone the tolerances to exactly what is needed. The goal was to
                  create a box with box joints that firmly holds itself together.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Poorly made software continued to be a blocker and a time sink this week.
                  Rhino has an incredibly steep learning curve while Bantam is simply an
                  all around terrible experience. Of the five hours it took to get to a 
                  solid cube, three of them were spent learning/troubleshooting what
                  is actually a very simple process.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Once I was cutting, it took eight test cuts to get the tolerances within
                  0.001mm (1μm). I found that the difference between 5μm made a sizable 
                  difference in fit. This was, by a large margin, the most precise fabrication
                  technique I have worked with so far. Getting the fit so perfect, and 
                  repeatable, was super satisfying.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>This week didn't produce as visual of a learning process as 
              previous weeks have, but it was just as involved.
            </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4>Digital Design</h4>
            <p>I started by creating the profile for each of the cube's sides in Rhino. The cube was made to
              be 20mm, but after offsetting the profile by 0.055mm for the tongues and grooves to fit
              together, an exact cube size was lost. If an exact size was desired, I think it could be done by 
              finding the amount the mill removes or by finding the setting that controls tool pathing in 
              relation to the profile line. The initial profile, before offset, would also have to compensate
              for the offset.
              
              
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a4/Rhino.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              <p>
                I offset the profile inwardly because when I was offsetting outwardly, the dogbone cuts that I set 
                to be 1mm in diamter were becoming too small for the tooling to cut. Then export to a .dxf file type.

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a4/KiCad.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              <p>In KiCad, it's simply importing the .dxf file and plotting it to be transferred to Bantam.

              <p>
                Bantam is where settings specific to the Othermill can be changed, though good luck using this software. 
                It's so poorly made that I couldn't even see the d-pad for moving the cutter head when setting the 
                touch-off point. I had to remove my FR1 from the table so the tool would be unobstructed.

          <h4>Fabrication</h4>
          <p>My first several cuts were simply to get the fit of my pieces just right. At first, I altered the offset
            in Rhino based on measuremnets taken with calipers, but the last three or four of my adjustments
            were based on the feel of them fitting together.

            <img src="./assets/images/a4/Fit Tests.jpeg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
          </div>
          <p>Once I got the fit right, it was just a matter of cutting my cube once and assembling it.

            <p>Now I'm thinking about how I can use what I learned to make something awesome like a 3D PCB or just
              a simple circuit that's built into the object.

<!-- Since it was so repeatable, I was quickly 
able to make something a bit more fun than a cube.

I wanted to lean into the intended purpose of the FR1 and make something fun
that also showed off the tight tolerances I worked so hard to get.  -->

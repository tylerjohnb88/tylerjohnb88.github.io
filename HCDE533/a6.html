                <h3>Echoing Wren</h3>
                <p>The task for this project was to create a 3D model of a mold for creating a
                    two-part silicon mold that could then be used to cast multiples of the 
                    desired object.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The first part of the project focused on creating the 3D printed mold for 
                  the silicon mold. Designing a mold in Rhino is fairly easy, but there is
                  a lot of forethought that needs to go into how everything will fit together
                  and how liquid will flow within both molds.
                  <!-- <br>
                  <br>
                  Learning to use Rhino this week has been very time consuming, but I am 
                  beginning to see the powerful aspects of Rhino over Soldiworks or AutoCAD.
                  While I mostly followed tutorials and resources on Rhino's website this
                  week, I have enjoyed the visual coding process of Grasshopper. The only
                  considerable roadblocks I ran into is that the software is not as efficient
                  when it comes to rendering changes. If I changed the thickness of my
                  material, this would result in 2-5 minutes of processing before becoming 
                  responsive again.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Some pieces ripped due to having very thin connections. I could have done 
                  better at predicting this and fixing those trouble areas. I would have 
                  also mapped the cuts on the taller pieces to be shorter and closer to the 
                  top of the piece so that it didn't create such floppy tabs. This endes up 
                  being a highly complicated puzzle, so I would mark pieces with their number 
                  if I were to do this again. I'm happy with the shape and all that I had to
                  learn in Rhino to accomplish what I had in my mind at the outset. All 
                  together, there are 58 laser-cut pieces. -->

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>I wanted to find something that my wife and I could paint together since plaster
                is just a blank canvas asking for paint. We love seeing all the house finches,
                black-eyed juncos, and the ocassional wren while walking around campus and since
                they're all all about the same size, paint could be the only distinction needed 
                to make all three from one mold.
                <br>
                <br>
                Searching through Thingiverse, I found this 
                <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:124076" title="" class="link-like-text">model of a wren</a>
                that would work.

        <div class="row">
          <h4>Digital Design</h4>
            <p>Opening the .stl file in Rhino, I started by removing the wren's legs because I
                knew they would be near impossible to do well with a two-part mold. I also trimmed
                some of it's body to create a flat base for sitting on a flat surface. 
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a6/Legless.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Next, I created a parting line for the mold to split on.
                <a href="./assets/images/a6/3D Printing for Two-Part Silicone Molds 13 Steps - Instructables.pdf" title="" class="link-like-text"> This guide</a> 
                <a href="https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printing-for-Two-Part-Silicone-Molds/" title="" class="link-like-text">(source)</a>
                on 3D printing two-part silicon molds was really helpful.
            </p>

              <img src="./assets/images/a6/Wren Parting Line.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>After following the steps in the rest of the guide, I had a 3D printable mold for
                the silicone. Or so I thought.
              </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a6/Wren Mold Mold v1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>The pour hole was the only potential complication I foresaw. I placed it on the bottom 
                surface so that any artifacts from the pour would be hidden, but this means
                that I'd have to break the funnel off of my 3D printed mold in 
                order to remove the silicone mold.
                <br>
                <br>
                At this point, I thought my model was near printable... it was not. I ran
                into a lot of problems with how the division line was modeled. It ended up
                taking me many more hours of learning Rhino the hard way, trying all the 
                buttons that seemed even minorly related. I ended up changing the parting line 
                from the complex one to a flat, centerline. This worked much better for modeling,
                but made for more work when it came to cleaning up the cast birds.

          <h4>Fabrication</h4>
          <p>I have finally learned enough about 3D printing to start a print liike this and
            have it work the first time. Troubleshooting is satisfying for the learning that
            comes from it, but it's often more satisfying to just hit print and know your
            settings are correct.

          </div>
          <p>Designing the mold was the hardest part. Everyhing else went smoothly and it 
            was mostly just taking notes on what to improve next time. The silicone pour
            went as expected, but there were steps I would have liked to take if 3D modeling
            hadn't already taken all my time away. Things like placing the 3D-printed mold mold
            into an acetone bath to smooth the print lines and using a vaccuum chamber to remove 
            bubbles were both things I had planned for, but ran out of time. There were two small
            bubbles on the inside surface of my mold and obviously the print lines would be
            visible on any casts.
          </p>

          </div>
            <p>I chose to measure by weight for better accuracy and one less cup coated in 
                silicone. For Oomoo 30, this meant 1 part A : 1.3 part B.

          </div>
          <p>Pouring slowly and starting from a low point was recommended in the Oomoo 
            instructions and did seem to help some with bubbles. Placing strips of scrap
            fabric beneath the mold mold made all the difference when it came time to demold.
            I let the mold cure for 10 hours before demolding, but the instructions recommended
            6.

          <p>Overall, it wasn't a bad mold. I was a little worried about having no keys
            and how much extra work this would make for me with each cast, but once I 
            trimmed the edges and cut the keys off, it was fairly easy to line the two
            halves up well enough for 6 casts.
          </p>

          I found that 70g of plaster mix was about what this mold required. I used 20g of
          water with 55g of plaster. I'm not sure how much it actually helped, but my thought
          was that by adding a higher ratio of water than the recommended 3 parts plaster : 
          1 part water would help the slury fill the small shapes formes by the beak and tail.

          </div>
          <p>The first cast ended up with a lot of tiny bubbles at the topside of the pour.
            I was able to almost entirely remove these in subsequent pours by pouring a small
            amount of plaster in and rotating the mold to coat all sides before filling the 
            rest more slowly. Each pour took 20 minutes to harden enough to demold.

          <p><b>Other things I learned...</b>
            <br>
            1. Leveling the botom on my model was a good idea, but it ended up
            causing the bird's center of mass to be too far forward. Going back to fix 
            this would have been worth it if I were casting more than a handful of small 
            birds. I ended up changing the angle on each bird with sand paper and a sponge 
            and, halfway through, I found that filling the mold just below full took care 
            of this problem.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Even though I was warned, my keys were still too small. On top of that, I offset
            my positive keys in the model (negative keys on the mold) inward to create some 
            room for them to mate once they were silicon. They should have been offset outward, 
            further exacerbating the problem of being too small.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Plaster is much easier to smooth out and finish immediately after demolding,
            before it has time to cool.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lastly, more as a note to my future self, making a mold of a bunch of spheres
            would be great for any left over plaster. Plaster has a really nice weight to 
            it and could be used to fill cavities in a lamp base or any product where some
            extra weight is needed.

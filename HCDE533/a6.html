                <h3>Echoing Wren</h3>
                <p>The task for this project was to create a 3D model of a mold for creating a
                    two-part silicon mold that could then be used to cast multiples of the 
                    desired object.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The first part of the project focused on creating the 3D printed mold for 
                  the silicon mold. Designing a mold in Rhino is fairly easy, but there is
                  a lot of forethought that needs to go into how everything will fit together
                  and how liquid will flow within both molds.
                  <!-- <br>
                  <br>
                  Learning to use Rhino this week has been very time consuming, but I am 
                  beginning to see the powerful aspects of Rhino over Soldiworks or AutoCAD.
                  While I mostly followed tutorials and resources on Rhino's website this
                  week, I have enjoyed the visual coding process of Grasshopper. The only
                  considerable roadblocks I ran into is that the software is not as efficient
                  when it comes to rendering changes. If I changed the thickness of my
                  material, this would result in 2-5 minutes of processing before becoming 
                  responsive again.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Some pieces ripped due to having very thin connections. I could have done 
                  better at predicting this and fixing those trouble areas. I would have 
                  also mapped the cuts on the taller pieces to be shorter and closer to the 
                  top of the piece so that it didn't create such floppy tabs. This endes up 
                  being a highly complicated puzzle, so I would mark pieces with their number 
                  if I were to do this again. I'm happy with the shape and all that I had to
                  learn in Rhino to accomplish what I had in my mind at the outset. All 
                  together, there are 58 laser-cut pieces. -->

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>I wanted to find something that my wife and I could paint together since plaster
                is just a blank canvas asking for paint. We love seeing all the house finches,
                black-eyed juncos, and the ocassional wren while walking around campus and since
                they're all all about the same size, paint could be the only distinction needed 
                to make all three from one mold.
                <br>
                <br>
                Searching through Thingiverse, I found this 
                <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:124076" title="" class="link-like-text">model of a wren</a>
                that would work.

        <div class="row">
          <h4>Digital Design</h4>
            <p>Opening the .stl file in Rhino, I started by removing the wren's legs because I
                knew they would be near impossible to do well with a two-part mold. I also trimmed
                some of it's body to create a flat base for sitting on a flat surface.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Next, I created a parting line for the mold to split on.

                on 3D printing two-part silicon molds was really helpful.

            </div>
            <p>After following the steps in the rest of the guide, I had a 3D printable mold for
                the silcon.

            <p>The pour hole is the only potential complication. I place it on the bottom 
                surface so that any artifacts from the pour would be hidden, but this means
                that I'm going to have the break this funnel off of my 3D printed mold in 
                order to remove the silicon mold.

          <h4>Fabrication</h4>
          <p>Cutting was much faster this week as I kept scale in mind during design. 
            I numbered each piece in Rhino, but didn't want numbers to be visible on the final 
            assembly, so I used my digital model as a guide for this time consuming puzzle.

          </div>
            <p>The puzzle would have been more fun to do in recreation than under a deadline
            and the pieces would benefit from more time being spent making sure there aren't
            any thin connections that make them flimsy to handle.

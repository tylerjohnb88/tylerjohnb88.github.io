                <h3>Lava Sculpture</h3>
                <p>In week one I learned about some of the difficulties that come from 
                  working with 3D objects that have already been converted to .stl files.
                  Since this is unfortunately a common way to share 3D objects in 
                  machine-based making communities, it's a good skill to build.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>In the first week of this two-week project we were instructed to learn 
                about combining and editing meshes by combining two .stl files from the 
                internet.

        <div class="row">
            <h4>Tool Learning</h4>
              <p>I found that it's a good idea to gather as many .stl options as possible.
                For example, I wanted to perch a crow on a hand, but the first crow
                I chose had a lot of intersecting face pairs that caused some of the
                mesh to tear when I performed a boolean union between meshes. The
                faces of the triangles were so small on the crow that it didn't seem 
                possible to repair them.  
              </p>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./assets/images/a5/Rendered After (Fail) 2 Show Edges.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./assets/images/a5/Rendered After (Fail) 2 Check.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              </div>
              <p>It wasn't hard to find resources on how to fix holes in meshes online 
                since this is a comon problem, but I had more trouble with the resolution
                of the triangles being so high. After spending a good amount of time trying
                to fix the holes, I decided to try another crow with a resolution similar
                to the hand I was using. This worked much better!
                </p>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./assets/images/a5/Rendered After - Check.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">

          </div>



        <div class="row">
          <h4>Digital Design</h4>
            <p>Just like I did with the lava shapes in 
              <a href="./a2.html" title="" class="link-like-text">A2: 3D Modeling & Organic Art</a>,
              I started by creating a blocky mesh structure by following 
              <a href="https://youtu.be/jI6IOfhJ51c?si=9a-G2a5BOfqa3XPJ" title="" class="link-like-text">this tutorial</a>.
              Then, I used reference geometry to trim the top and bottom off the rounded shape.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a5/Object Progression.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Next, I'll try lofting between this surface and a woven set of curves to get
                closer to the final shape.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./assets/images/a5/tylerjohnb_a_3D-printed_lamp_nature_evening_product_photography_abcd387d-f750-4260-8a52-0d1c80ff8709.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

            </div>
            <p>This is where Rhino became really helpful. Each slot needed to be a 
              different depth depending on the shape of the piece, so I used Grasshopper
              to determine those depths, create a bounding box that's ties to the
              material thickness, and cut slots into each piece based on those parameters.
              I left the cut size slightly larger than snug for an individual piece
              so that it wouldn't be impossible to slot 1 piece into 5 later on. 
              <br><br>
              See my 
              <a href="./assets/images/a2/Lava 3D Shape.3dm" title="" class="link-like-text">Rhino File</a> and 
              <a href="./assets/images/a2/Lava 3D Shape.gh" title="" class="link-like-text">Grasshopper File</a>.

              <img src="./assets/images/a2/Final Model.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              This is what my shape looked like after using Grasshopper to divide it 
              into x and y slices.

              <img src="./assets/images/a2/Interlocks.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              Here you can see the cuts that were determined by the shape.
              <br><br>
              Thank you to Rhino for having such a great 
              <a href="https://vimeo.com/35707093" title="" class="link-like-text">tutorial</a> 
              on 3D puzzles. This helped me figure everything out much quicker.
              <br><br>
              I'm sure there is a programming solution to mapping pieces onto a piece of material
              in the most efficient pattern and I would have liked to spend more time
              finding this option but figured manually arranging pieces was fastest for now.

          <h4>Fabrication</h4>
          <p>Cutting was much faster this week as I kept scale in mind during design. 
            I numbered each piece in Rhino, but didn't want numbers to be visible on the final 
            assembly, so I used my digital model as a guide for this time consuming puzzle.
            <img src="./assets/images/a2/Laser Cut Pieces.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="">

            <img src="./assets/images/a2/Assembled1.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="">
          </div>
            <p>The puzzle would have been more fun to do in recreation than under a deadline
            and the pieces would benefit from more time being spent making sure there aren't
            any thin connections that make them flimsy to handle.

                <h3>Nature Drip</h3>
                <p>I learned about some of the difficulties that come from 
                  working with 3D objects that have already been converted to .stl files.
                  Since this is unfortunately a common way to share 3D objects in 
                  machine-based making communities, it's a good skill to build.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>In this project we were instructed to learn 
              about combining and editing meshes by combining two .stl files from the 
              internet before designing a lamp that utilizes some of what we learned.
              I chose a hand and a crow to perch on the hand.

            <p>After that, I planned to design a lamp based on this image I generated with Midjourney.

        <div class="row">
            <h4>Tool Learning</h4>
              <p>Early on, I found that it's a good idea to gather as many .stl options as possible.
                For example, I wanted to perch a crow on a hand, but the first crow
                I chose had a lot of intersecting face pairs that caused some of the
                mesh to tear when I performed a boolean union between meshes. The
                faces of the triangles were so small on the crow that it didn't seem 
                possible to repair them before the union.  
              </p>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./assets/images/a5/Rendered After (Fail) 2 Show Edges.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./assets/images/a5/Rendered After (Fail) 2 Check.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              </div>
              <p>It wasn't hard to find resources on how to fix holes in meshes online 
                since this is a common problem, but I had more trouble with the resolution
                of the triangles being so high. After spending a good amount of time trying
                to fix the holes, I decided to try another crow with a resolution similar
                to the hand I was using. This worked much better!
                </p>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./assets/images/a5/Rendered After - Check.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">

              </div>
          </div>



        <div class="row">
          <h4>Digital Design</h4>
            <p>Just like I did with the lava shapes in 
              <a href="./a2.html" title="" class="link-like-text">A2: 3D Modeling & Organic Art</a>,
              I started by creating a blocky mesh structure by following 
              <a href="https://youtu.be/jI6IOfhJ51c?si=9a-G2a5BOfqa3XPJ" title="" class="link-like-text">this tutorial</a>.
              Then, I used reference geometry to trim the top and bottom off the rounded shape.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a5/Object Progression.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>This is where I stopped for week one and I couldn't return to it in week two
              due to an unexpected trip that I had to make for a family event. I would explore
              options for lofting between this surface and a woven set of curves to get
              closer to the surface texture of the final shape. Draping, Shrinkwrapping, or 
              methods of Repelling or Attracting in Grasshopper might be good places to start.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./assets/images/a5/Surface Textures.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>I'm confident that this would be a design that would cast light in interesting
              ways. I think there are additional challenges I would have had to overcome
              besides the modeling of
              the surface. 
              <br><br>
              One would have been integrating a planter into the lamp in a way that keeps
              water away from the lamp components. My plan for this was to either put the 
              lamp in the upper "bulb" contour and the planter in the base, or use an LED
              light source that is water proof.
              <br><br>
              Another would have likely been printing since I have yet to print something
              this large, though I don't know what challenges I would have run into here.
              <br><br>
              One more might have been getting the lamp components to fit correctly, but I
              don't suspect this would have been very challenging since I'm comfortable with
              the accurate integration of precise components from my previous career and from
              <a href="./a1.html" title="" class="link-like-text">A1: Lasers & Cardboard</a>.
              </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a1/LampHardware2.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              Integrating hardware with the lamp I made in

              Designing with light is really enjoyable, but challenging. I had hoped that more
              light would leak through the layers of leaves.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a5/Past Work.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              This was one of the more challenging hardware integrations I've done.
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>I will likely return to this project in the future because it presents several
              intersting challenges for mass production. The design is also something that I
              enjoy and want to see in reality.
            </p>

          <h4>Fabrication</h4>
          <p>Cutting was much faster this week as I kept scale in mind during design. 
            I numbered each piece in Rhino, but didn't want numbers to be visible on the final 
            assembly, so I used my digital model as a guide for this time consuming puzzle.
            <img src="./assets/images/a2/Laser Cut Pieces.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="">

            <img src="./assets/images/a2/Assembled1.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="">
          </div>
            <p>The puzzle would have been more fun to do in recreation than under a deadline
            and the pieces would benefit from more time being spent making sure there aren't
            any thin connections that make them flimsy to handle.
          </p>
          <div class="col-md-6">
           <p>I think it turned out good enough to enjoy on display.</p>

                <h3>Lava Sculpture</h3>
                <p>The task this week was to learn how to model in Rhino, then bring that 
                  model to life. Again, the creation needed a minimum of 30 laser-cut 
                  parts featuring interlocking slots that ensure a secure press fit, 
                  resistant to light shaking.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Last week, I enjoyed the challenge of creating something that I'll use
                  or would be happy gifting so much that I'm going to strive for this 
                  every week. I wanted to introduce some color to this week's project too.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Learning to use Rhino this week has been very time consuming, but I am 
                  beginning to see the powerful aspects of Rhino over Soldiworks or AutoCAD.
                  While I mostly followed tutorials and resources on Rhino's website this
                  week, I have enjoyed the visual coding process of Grasshopper. The only
                  considerable roadblocks I ran into is that the software is not as efficient
                  when it comes to rendering changes. If I changed the thickness of my
                  material, this would result in 2-5 minutes of processing before becoming 
                  responsive again.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Some pieces ripped due to having very thin connections. I could have done 
                  better at predicting this and fixing those trouble areas. I would have 
                  also mapped the cuts on the taller pieces to be shorter and closer to the 
                  top of the piece so that it didn't create such floppy tabs. This endes up 
                  being a highly complicated puzzle, so I would mark pieces with their number 
                  if I were to do this again. I'm happy with the shape and all that I had to
                  learn in Rhino to accomplish what I had in my mind at the outset. All 
                  together, there are 58 laser-cut pieces.

            <p>I've also been looking for an excuse to learn how to make topographical models like this.</p>

          <h4>Digital Design</h4>
            <p>I started by creating a blocky mesh structure, after hours of trying various 
              techniques, then I turned that shape into a Sub-D by following 
              <a href="https://youtu.be/jI6IOfhJ51c?si=9a-G2a5BOfqa3XPJ" title="" class="link-like-text">this tutorial</a>.

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a2/Mesh.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img src="./assets/images/a2/SubD.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>This is where Rhino became really helpful. Each slot needed to be a 
              different depth depending on the shape of the piece, so I used Grasshopper
              to determine those depths, create a bounding box that's ties to the
              material thickness, and cut slots into each piece based on those parameters.
              I left the cut size slightly larger than snug for an individual piece
              so that it wouldn't be impossible to slot 1 piece into 5 later on. 
              <br><br>

              <a href="./assets/images/a2/Lava 3D Shape.3dm" title="" class="link-like-text">Rhino File</a> and

              This is what my shape looked like after using Grasshopper to divide it 
              into x and y slices.

              Here you can see the cuts that were determined by the shape.
              <br><br>
              Thank you to Rhino for having such a great 
              <a href="https://vimeo.com/35707093" title="" class="link-like-text">tutorial</a> 
              on 3D puzzles. This helped me figure everything out much quicker.
              <br><br>
              I'm sure there is a programming solution to mapping pieces onto a piece of material
              in the most efficient pattern and I would have liked to spend more time
              finding this option but figured manually arranging pieces was fastest for now.

          <h4>Fabrication</h4>
          <p>Cutting was much faster this week as I kept scale in mind during design. 
            I numbered each piece in Rhino, but didn't want numbers to be visible on the final 
            assembly, so I used my digital model as a guide for this time consuming puzzle.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <img src="./assets/images/a2/Assembled1.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            <p>The puzzle would have been more fun to do in recreation than under a deadline
              and the pieces would benefit from more time being spent making sure there aren't
              any thin connections that make them flimsy to handle.

        Assignment 1 was about learning how to work with 
        resistors, LEDs, and basic circuits.

    <p>A 220立 resistor was used for the red LED and 100立
      resistors were used for the blue and white LEDs in 
      order to keep the amperage below 20mA for each 
      cicuit, the recommended max for this Arduino.

            1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and 
            the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a 
            line for each of your 3 LEDs.

            2: How many LEDs could you blink at once with 
            your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the 5v limitations of the Arduino is the 
          limiting factor. Therefore, I could chain two red,
          green, or yellow LEDs with a 220立 resistor for 
          a current draw of 0.006A
          OR a single blue, pink, or white LED with a 100立 
          resistor for a current draw of 0.017A.

              3: How many LEDs could you blink with your 
              Arduino if only one were to be on at once?

            4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Even blinking it for 1 milisecond with a second between
          blinks, the blink was visible. If the blink and pause 
          between blinks is 1 milisecond, then the LED simply 
          appears to remain on.

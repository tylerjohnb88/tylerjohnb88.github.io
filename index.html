        Hello :) 
        <br>
        My name is Tyler, I'm an HCDE major working to hone 
        my product design and project management abilities. I'm currently
        interested in the design space around products that rely on gestures
        as the main source of user input. After much thought and even more 
        reading, I see this as a stepping point towards brain-computer interfaces
        becoming a ubiquitous technology. These are some of my explorations into
        this space.

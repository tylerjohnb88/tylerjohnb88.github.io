            1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and 
            the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a 
            line for each of your 3 LEDs.

            2: How many LEDs could you blink at once with 
            your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the 5v limitations of the Arduino is the 
          limiting factor. Therefore, I could chain two red,
          green, or yellow LEDs with a 220Ω resistor for 
          a current draw of 0.006A
          OR a single blue, pink, or white LED with a 100Ω 
          resistor for a current draw of 0.017A.

              3: How many LEDs could you blink with your

            4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Even blinking it for 1 milisecond with a second between
          blinks, the blink was visible. If the blink and pause 
          between blinks is 1 milisecond, then the LED simply 
          appears to remain on.
